# Tableau Dashboard: 
## Exploring Median Compensation in the Data Science Field

### Introduction
In the competitive field of data science, understanding salary trends is crucial for both recruiters and job seekers. However, while average salaries are commonly discussed, median salary provides a more accurate representation of typical earnings. This project aims to explore median compensation in the data science field and highlight its importance in recruitment discussions.

### Data Source
The raw data for this project was obtained from AI-Jobs.net, a leading recruitment firm specializing in AI, machine learning, and data science roles. The data was processed and transformed using Python before visualization.

### Future Work
- Include city and state-level data for a more granular analysis within the United States.
- Add comparisons with average salaries to demonstrate the superiority of median salary as a metric.
- Compare median compensation across different regions, including Africa, Oceania, the Americas, and Asia.
