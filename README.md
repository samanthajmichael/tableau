# tableau
This is my first tableau story project

Introduction: 
Median salary is not a widely used statistic when discussing job prospects with recruiters. Most often we rely on 'average' salary


Data/operation abstraction design:
Raw data was procured from an AI/ML/Data Science recruitment firm, AI-Jobs.net and then transformed with Python

Future work:
I plan to continue working on the dashboard to include data at the city and state level in the US. I also plan on doing a comparison to the state median and average salary for comparison purposes
